Creating and empowering vibrotactile play in physical games 

# Introduction:

Since 1976, computer games have leveraged haptic output in   game controllers.[1] However, at present, no open source platform exists to easily facilitate embodied vibrotactile games for Independent Games Creators interested in creating physical games. This PhD explores what is known about using vibrotactile actuators from the field of HCI with the intent to apply this knowledge to the field of games. How does what is known in HCI around haptics expand embodied game design possibilities? What innovations in play have yet to be considered in the field of HCI? Through an informed co-design collaboration with independent games designers, common design considerations for vibrotactile physical games and will emerge and be explored and identified. From these collaborations, an initial framework of both knowledge and open source software for the game community will be produced to facilitate game designers to develop embodied, haptic games. 

**Research Questions:**
1. What is known about the state of vibrotactile interfaces on the skin in HCI?  
2. How have console, mobile and physical games used haptics previously? What are the common design considerations across  these categories? What are the divergent differences between  physical games and console or mobile games? 
3. Considering questions one and two, what are the open and unexplored aspects of research that can applied across both games and HCI?  
4. How can these opportunities be leveraged into a technological platform to empower independent developers to explore these domains? 

# Timeline for Lit review and First Experiments

### Literature Review  
**HCI**
* What is the state of the art in vibrotactile research 
* what is known about vibrotactile perception on the skin
* What is the frequency response of the skin given a VT device 
* What is the useful amplitude range for interface design for human perception 
* What are the kinds of transducers used and for what ends 
* What is know about sensory inhibition in vibrotactile interfaces 
**Games** 
* Survey of games using vibrotactile feedback in console & mobile games
* Identification of common use cases 
* Definition of physical Indie games and survey of these games using haptics 
* Identification of common use cases across categories 

**Mixed Methods Analysis**
* Development of a matrix for possible exploration based on HCI methods yet to be explore in game

* Develop a matrix of games practices yet to be analyzed in HCI research 

### Thrum
* Interview of Heather Kelley about the modalities and experiences she wants to explore
