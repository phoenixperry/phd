Notes from PhD meeting  

Explained Thrum concept  
Sound -- is it acting as a cue  
Sound is vibration - noise // is haptic  

Speakers  
Feel the direction it comes in - direction sound and vibration from  
What are the parameters are effecting the sound  
How can you control it  
How can you use it with the material and control  
How can you change speed virbro tactile  
Pulse patterns change how it's perceived  
Numbness happens  
Sensory Inhibition happens  

Lit survey you have to do something that goes into great detail on what the percetpion on vibrotactile  
What other people are doing  
State of the art in vibro tactile research  
Research that has been done on vibrotactile devices and human perception  
You want to know if people have hooked at Sensory Inhibition with  
Skin sensitivity  
What is the frequency response of the skin given the VT device  
What is the amplitude range which is useful --  
What do people know about these devices  
What kind of materials do people use to build these  
What kinds of Tranducers do people use / why do they use them  
Methodology of the difference from games and HCI  
How games studies and how HCI interact  
Game play with vibrotactile --  
3 pieces 
Synthesis the outcomes from this stage and reflects what is learned  
describe the project  
Methodology for evaluation  
Results  
Conclusion of what you are taking that  
What problems are being raised that must be raised 
Lit review & Thrum  
Chapter 1 & 2  
Plan those chapters  
Lit review in 2 months  
write up a plan and share it  
Timeline for upgrade plan -- send this to Mick  
With milestones  
2 docs   
Framework for lit review  
Framework for write up  

Sound work what Sonic Bed by Kath Mathews  
References to pull together and mention  
Interactive devices  
Current state with body and v.t. Responses are  
What is going on?  
Vibrotactile games /  
Expladn the field of play with our sensory systems  
Game Development as user groups  
What kind of gamer are in this  
Heather Kelley - game design / developers  
New platform for vibrotactile   
Question who the platform is for 
How it means the needs of the users  
What it is about the platform that is different than what they do on their own  
Is it a software library??  
Unity library? For triggering vibro tactile device  
Game design platform  
Kinds of games that can be made with this  
Writing and showing your own work and putting it out there -  
Basic tools  

Concentrate on what new knowledge I can create and how I can communicate that to a PhD  
Game designers as target - you have to work with them. The info has to be communicated with them  

Interview her formally (Heather)  

How you gather data on how you use this  
Pay attention to what questions heather things are important  

Methodlogy part in the lit review end that talks about how you are going to evaluate the users of thrums  
Methods chapter  
Here is what's know from an HCI side then how you can do that?  
User centered design approach  

Intro and a short intro on methodology -  
Mixed methods approach to development  

TO DO Write up notes and then timeline on draft chapters - 
Milestones with bulletpoint list  

Approach for evaluating what I am doing    

• Goal is how to best build a framework for game designer who want to explore virbro tactile games 
Research based on practice prototype  
Survey more games designers than 2 - 10 or 11?  
Questions that would lead me on follow up with my users  
Are there key similarities or differences between these folks  

Does this tell me anything  
Use that info to create a survey for more Devs on vibrotactile games  
Case studies and then broader
